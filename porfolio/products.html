            <h4>BBL juice </h4>
            <h4 class="Price">40$</h4>
            <p>The BBL juice started as a cleanse that could be for anyone , but when considering the ingredents and the positive effects it had on the  active and inactive women inparticullar it was time to rebrand. Ladies why pay for the fake when you can pay half the fee and get your body right and also healthy with me . The BBL juice is a multi day cleanse (pack of 4). For 4 days drink one juice a day along with 2 liters of water and light meals.The BBL juice comes in two options a clear (active/Physical activity  often ) and a green (unactive/No Physical activity ).The clear is a soft cleanse and the green is a deep cleanse. While both options may lead to  urianary frequency as well as more bowel movements than normal the green will produce more bathroom visits than the clear due to the ingredents and also potency due to the purpose of deep  cleaning the guts of women ho dont frequently sweat out toxcins and break down certain foods in gut.  (See Nutrition page for ingredents and details )
